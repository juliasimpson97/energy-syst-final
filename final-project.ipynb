    "## Introduction\n",
    "You take the position of a policy maker to provide policy suggestions to decarbonize ISO New England and are given the attached one-bus system model and. Details about this system model are explained in the attached paper. Note the model in this paper has 8 buses with no transmission limits, so it is equivalent to a single-bus model (ISO New England has minor congestion issues).\n",
    "ISONE expects to install a total wind generation capacity of 12,000 MW by 2030 and would like to study how to best integrate wind generation. You are provided with one week (168 hours) of data including wind generation capacity factors and demand. The wind generator capacity factor is a normalized value between zero to one representation ratio between the actual wind generation and the installed wind capacity over each hour."

    "## Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Please finish a report summarizing how to best integrate up to 12,000 MW of wind generation into the system and how the wind generation would impact the system operating cost. You should explore three levels of wind capacity:\n",
    "- Low: 2,000 MW\n",
    "- Medium: 6,000 MW • High: 12,000 MW\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement a unit commitment simulation and explore approaches that could improve the wind integration ratio, these approaches include but are not limited to\n",
    "- Add carbon tax that increases the cost of traditional generators. You can use the EIA website1 to look up emission factors of different fuel types.\n",
    "- Add tax incentives for wind integration, in this case, you should add a negative cost of wind generation wt to the objective function.\n",
    "- Retirement of coal power plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each scenario, use the following indexes to compare the system performance\n",
    "- The total generation cost.\n",
    "- The wind curtailment ratio - the ratio between the wind that was not integrated into the system\n",
    "(Wt − wt) to the total wind capacity available (Wt).\n",
    "- Profits received by generators.\n",
    "- The average electricity price.\n",
    "- The profit received by generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, your project and report should conclude your recommendation of the best solution that balances electricity cost, system-wide carbon emission, and generator revenue. Note that there will not be a unique solution, and you should use your own judgements about which one you think is the best."

    "## Directions\n",
    "1. The major effort in this project is to program a unit commitment model. **Wind generation should be modeled as a zero marginal cost resource (or negative marginal cost if it has tax credits) and can be curtailed**, i.e., wt ≤ WAt, where W are installed wind capacity, At is the time-variant capacity factor given in the data, and wt is the actual wind power integrated into the grid. w should be included in the nodal power balance as a generator. For the rest, please refer to the complete unit commitment formulation in the attachment.\n",
    "2. You are given a full week’s profile but performing a unit commitment with 168 hours might be overwhelming for your computer. Instead, you should perform sequential daily unit commitments of 24 hours, and pass decision variables as the starting point (in which they become coefficients) for your next unit commitment. These will include gi,t and ui,t. You must also update SUi, and SDi accordingly based on the start-up/down status. For your first operating day, you can assume all generators have been off long enough and set these parameters.\n",
    "3. The generator cost data includes a quadratic term and a linear term. **You can either use mixed- integer quadratic programming to solve it directly or apply piece-wise linear (five segments per generator max) to the cost curve and convert the problem into MILP.**\n",
    "4. You can assume all generators are off at the start of each scenario with a zero must-down time, i.e., you can start any generators at the start of the horizon.\n",
    "5. After implementing a functional unit commitment model, please adjust the installed wind power capacity and other intervention methods, observe the result from each scenario, and summarize the results in your report."
